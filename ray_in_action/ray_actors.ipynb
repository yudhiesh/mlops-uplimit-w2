    "# Why We Need Ray Actors\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Ray tasks is great for distributing work around a cluster, but we've said nothing so far about managing distributed state, one of the big challenges in distributed computing. Ray tasks are excellent for stateless computation, but we need something for stateful computation. Python classes are a familiar mechanism for encapsulating state. Just as Ray tasks extend the familiar concept of Python functions, Ray addresses stateful computation by extending classes to become Ray actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Mean by Distributed State\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've worked with data processing libraries like Pandas or big data tools like Apache Spark, you know that they provide rich features for manipulating large, structured data sets, i.e., the analogs of tables in a database. Some tools even support partitioning of these data sets over clusters for scalability. This isn't the kind of distributed \"state\" Ray addresses. Instead, it's the more open-ended graph of objects found in more general-purpose applications. For example, it could be the state of a game engine used in a reinforcement learning (RL) application or the total set of parameters in a giant neural network, some of which now have hundreds of millions of parameters. In the following examples, we'll explore how Ray actors can be used to manage distributed state in various scenarios.\n",

    "# Monte Carlo Estimation of π\n",
    "This tutorial shows you how to estimate the value of π using a Monte Carlo method that works by randomly sampling points within a 2x2 square. We can use the proportion of the points that are contained within the unit circle centered at the origin to estimate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square. Given that we know the true ratio to be π/4, we can multiply our estimated ratio by 4 to approximate the value of π. The more points that we sample to calculate this approximation, the closer the value should be to the true value of π."
